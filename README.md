# Ethereum-transactions-crawler in python

Create an application that will allow a user to view transaction data from the Ethereum blockchain associated with a specific wallet address W that the user inputs, starting with block B. The application should get information on:
wallets (addresses) and 
amounts of ETH associated with transactions made to and from the given wallet W and
show them in a simple human-readable way. 
The application collects and displays ALL transaction data starting from the given block B
Given a date in YYYY-MM-DD format, the program returns the exact value of ETH that was available on the given address at YYYY-MM-DD 00:00 UTC time.
